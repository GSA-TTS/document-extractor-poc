# 10. Pytest for Python Unit Testing.

Date: 2025-04-07

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Unit testing is important.  Using a dedicated unit testing framework helps streamline this process.  Frameworks
typically provide a straightforward syntax for test creation, a consistent output format that makes it easier to
interpret results, and a library of helpful utilities for setup, teardown, and reusable testing patterns.  This not only
encourages more consistent testing practices but also makes it simpler to integrate automated testing into continuous
integration (CI) pipelines.

## Decision

Our team decided to adopt Pytest for the following reasons:
1. Clear and concise test functions: Pytest makes it easy to write test cases by simply prefixing the test function name with “test_”.
2. No need for boilerplate: Unlike other frameworks, there is no mandatory requirement to use classes or complex setups unless they are needed.
3. Flexible fixtures: Pytest fixtures allow for reusable setup and teardown processes, helping test large code bases while maintaining clarity.
4. Extensive plugin ecosystem: Pytest’s plugin system facilitates additional features like code coverage, test reruns, and parallel execution without a complicated setup.
5. Readable output: Pytest’s default test output is human-friendly and can also be configured for more detailed reporting to trace failures.

## Consequences

1. Standardized Test Structure: By using Pytest across our codebase, all tests will follow a consistent naming convention and structure, improving overall readability.
2. Faster Development Cycle: Developers can quickly write, organize, and debug tests, leading to faster feedback on new code changes.
3. Enhanced Code Quality: More thorough test coverage promotes early bug detection, ultimately boosting application reliability.
4. Potential Learning Curve: While Pytest is intuitive, team members unfamiliar with it will need to learn new fixtures, command-line options, and best practices. However, the learning process is relatively quick, and the benefits outweigh the initial ramp-up time.
