## Introduction

The threat model is intended to ensure that the application is developed with security built-in from the beginning and
in an ongoing way.  By documenting potential threats and assets, along with countermeasures and mitigation actions
explicitly, better and more informed decisions can be made for improved security.

This document is stored in revision control along with the application code so that it is highly visible and accessible
to the individuals doing development and deployment and can be modified in concert with the code.
