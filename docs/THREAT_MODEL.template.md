## Introduction

The threat model is intended to ensure that the application is developed with security built-in from the beginning and
in an ongoing way.  By documenting potential threats and assets, along with countermeasures and mitigation actions
explicitly, better and more informed decisions can be made for improved security.

This document is stored in revision control along with the application code so that it is highly visible and accessible
to the individuals doing development and deployment and can be modified in concert with the code.

## Entry Points

1. Website.  Users interact with our application through the website.  Anyone can interact with the website.
2. API.  Users can interact with the API through the website or directly.
3. AWS console.  AWS credentials can be used to log into the AWS console directly and access data, code, and
   configuration.
4. S3 bucket document bucket.  The S3 bucket stores the documents and is written to by the application.

## Assets

1. The code itself.
2. The website.
3. Documents uploaded to the application.
4. The extracted data from the documents.

## Threats

```threatdown
__Make the application unavailable__
- Harness a botnet and throw a bunch of traffic at the website or API.
  - [x] AWS has built-in DDOS mitigations.
  - [ ] Pay for AWS Shield Advaced that provides additional protections.
- Change the code to become inoperable.
  - Have access to GitHub.
    - [x] GSA requires a user have a GSA e-mail, which requires a background check.
    - [x] GitHub accounts in the GSA GitHub organization requires two-factor authentication.
  - Have access to AWS to change code or other configuration.
    - [x] Protected by two-factor authentication and only specific individuals are given access.
- Suppy chain attack to make the larger application inoperable.
  - [x] We use well known dependencies distributed through well known distribution channels like PyPi and NPM.
  - [ ] Improve dependabot to automatically update dependencies.
  - [ ] Do SCA scanning.
```

```threatdown
__Steal the raw, uploaded documents__
- Access the S3 bucket.
  - Have access to AWS.
    - [x] Protected by two-factor authentication and only specific individuals are given access.
  - [x] Public access is completely disabled on the bucket.
  - [ ] Set a lifecycle policy to delete documents after a period of time.
- Change the code to exfiltrate the raw document.
  - Have access to GitHub.
    - [x] GSA requires a user have a GSA e-mail, which requires a background check.
    - [x] GitHub accounts in the GSA GitHub organization requires two-factor authentication.
- Suppy chain attack to exfiltrate the raw document.
  - [x] We use well known dependencies distributed through well known distribution channels like PyPi and NPM.
  - [ ] Improve dependabot to automatically update dependencies.
  - [ ] Do SCA scanning.
- Set a UUID in the frontend or call the API with UUID to get an S3 pre-signed URL.
  - [x] UUIDs are hard to guess because the range of values is so large
    > This is not good enough at all.  Someone could brute force the numbers and eventually encounter a document which will be devastating.  This must be fixed before real data is used.
  - [ ] Add AuthN/AuthZ so only allowed people are able to call the API with a UUID associated with them.
  - [ ] Add API trottling to slow down the brute force checking of a bunch of UUIDs.
```

```threatdown
__Steal the extracted data__
- Access the DynamoDB table.
